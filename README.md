# bviz

A graphical Bazel build visualization and inspection tool.

![bviz with a dependency graph, a trace profile, its flame graph and a console replay open side by side, split diagonally between the dark and light themes](docs/screenshots/bviz.png)

Seeing what a Bazel build actually did is hard. bviz reads the outputs Bazel
generates, such as query results, the trace profile and the build event log,
and lets you explore them visually.

> **This fork also builds bviz for the browser:** the same app, compiled to
> WebAssembly and drawn with WebGPU. `bazel run --config=wasm //web:serve`, then
> open http://127.0.0.1:8080. See [WASM.md](WASM.md).

bviz is early in development. Expect rough edges, and expect the interface and
command line to change.

## Features

bviz reads these Bazel outputs, alone or together:

- **`query`, `cquery` and `aquery` results:** one merged target and action
  graph to explore, search and filter, with views of why one target depends on
  another and what each dependency brings in.
- **Trace profile:** a timeline of the build, flame graphs and statistics of
  where the time went, and its critical path.
- **Build event log:** the build's console output and the outcome of each
  target.
- **Execution log:** where the time of each spawn went.

## Install

Download bviz for arm64 or x86_64 Linux or macOS from the
[latest release](https://github.com/yume-ag/bviz/releases/latest), or the latest
build of `main` from the
[nightly release](https://github.com/yume-ag/bviz/releases/tag/nightly).

| | Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | arm64, x86_64 | arm64, x86_64 |
| Operating system | glibc 2.28 or newer | macOS 14 or newer |
| Display | a Wayland session | |
| Graphics | a Vulkan driver | Metal |

On an X11 session, run bviz inside a nested Wayland compositor such as
[cage](https://github.com/cage-kiosk/cage): `cage -- bviz --profile build.profile.gz`.

The arm64 Linux and the macOS binaries are cross-compiled on x86_64 Linux and are
not tested in CI. The macOS binaries are not signed, and macOS blocks an unsigned
download until you clear its quarantine flag:
`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine bviz`.

bviz reads the outputs of Bazel 8.0 or newer.

To build from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick start

In a Bazel workspace, profile a build and open the profile:

```sh
bazel build --profile=/tmp/build.profile.gz //...
bviz --profile /tmp/build.profile.gz
```

## Usage

`bviz bazelrc` generates a Bazel config with every flag bviz needs. From the
workspace root:

```sh
mkdir -p .bviz && bviz bazelrc > .bviz/bazelrc
echo 'try-import %workspace%/.bviz/bazelrc' >> .bazelrc
```

Then follow the instructions at the top of `.bviz/bazelrc`.

Each input flag takes the file one Bazel invocation writes. The bazelrc adds
further flags that give the views more to show.
